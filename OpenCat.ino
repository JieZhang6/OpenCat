/*
   The driver for OpenCat, runs on ATmega328P-based NyBoard (as Arduino Uno).
   Compatible with Petoi Nybble, Bittle and many other 8 or 12 DoF quadruped robots.
   Drives up to 16 PWM servos.

  To configure the board:
  1. Select your robot and board version.
  2. Comment out #define MAIN_SKETCH and upload. Upload and follow the serial prompts to proceed.
  3. Uncomment #define MAIN_SKETCH to make it active. Then upload the program for main functions.
